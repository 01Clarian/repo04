Exercise for ZTM class working on fetch and promises using SWAPI API. additional practice with redux rewire.. 


Things To Improve Upon and In Progress:

3 states for each data request should be all refactored to 1. (API should be fetched from base url and expanded upon).

buttons should be triggering into one state toggle and not 3 separate ones. 

figure out Provider store for Tween (was not working with App.js *separated container is def wasteful in this case ha.
